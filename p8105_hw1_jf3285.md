## Problem 1

  - The purpose of this problem is to address variable types and
    introduce coercion.
  - Create a data frame comprised of: a random sample of size 8 from a
    standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether
    elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of
    length 8, a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor
    “levels”.
  - Take the mean of each variable in the dataframe.
  - Apply as.numeric function to the logical character, and factor
    variables.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# set seed to ensure reproducibility
set.seed(1234)

# create data frame
create_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = x > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Alexa", "Hello", "Hey", "Hi","Bye"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("low", "medium", "high", "high", "medium", "low", "medium", "medium"))
)

# return the first six rows of the data frame 
head(create_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 4
    ##        x vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##    <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ## 1 -1.21  FALSE       My       low       
    ## 2  0.277 TRUE        name     medium    
    ## 3  1.08  TRUE        is       high      
    ## 4 -2.35  FALSE       Alexa    high      
    ## 5  0.429 TRUE        Hello    medium    
    ## 6  0.506 TRUE        Hey      low

``` r
# calculate the mean of each variable in the data frame
# numeric and logical vectors work but character and factor vectors return NA
x_mean = mean(pull(create_df, x))
vec_logical_mean = mean(pull(create_df, vec_logical))
# vec_char_mean = mean(pull(create_df, vec_char))
# vec_factor_mean = mean(pull(create_df, vec_factor))

# apply as.numeric function to the logical, character and factor variables
as.numeric(pull(create_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0

``` r
# as numeric(character vector) returns NA
as.numeric(pull(create_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(create_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## [1] 2 3 1 1 3 2 3 3

By taking the mean of each variable in the dataframe, it can be seen
that the mean operation can be done on numeric and logical variables
whereas such operation will generate errors for character and factor
variables.

When applying as.numeric function to explicitly coerce logical,
character and factor variables into numeric variables, logical vectors
were converted into 0s and 1s - corresponding to the TRUE(s)/FALSE(s),
factor vectors were converted into 1s, 2s, and 3s - corresponding to the
three different factor levels; however, R failed to convert character
vectors into numeric vectors, generating error “NA introduced by
coercion”, which indicated that R could not assign numeric values to
character variables composed of strings (without levels).

This helps explain the situation of taking the mean: mean operation
cannot be performed on character or factor vector due to its non-numeric
or non-logical attribute, but factor vector can be converted into
numeric vector due to its “levelness”, helping R better assign numeric
values.

  - This part of code chunk converts logical vectors to numeric and
    factor
vectors.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# logical vectors are converted to numeric and factor vectors + numeric operations
# logical -> numeric
convert_logi_numeric = as.numeric(pull(create_df, vec_logical))
result1 = convert_logi_numeric*(pull(create_df, x))
result1

## Problem 2

  - This problem focuses on the use of inline R code, plotting and the
    bahavior of ggplot for different variable types.
  - Create a data frame comprised of: x: a random sample of size 500
    from a standard Normal distribution, y: a random sample of size 500
    from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating
    whether x + y \> 1, a numeric vector created by coercing the above
    logical vector, a factor vector created by coercing the above
    logical vector.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# set seed to ensure reproducibility
set.seed(1234)

# create data frame
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  logi_vec = c(x+y) > 1,
  num_vec = as.numeric(logi_vec),
  factor_vec = as.factor(logi_vec)
)

# return the first six rows of the data frame 
head(plot_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 5
    ##        x      y logi_vec num_vec factor_vec
    ##    <dbl>  <dbl> <lgl>      <dbl> <fct>     
    ## 1 -1.21   0.985 FALSE          0 FALSE     
    ## 2  0.277 -1.22  FALSE          0 FALSE     
    ## 3  1.08   0.710 TRUE           1 TRUE      
    ## 4 -2.35  -0.109 FALSE          0 FALSE     
    ## 5  0.429  1.78  TRUE           1 TRUE      
    ## 6  0.506 -0.243 FALSE          0 FALSE

``` r
# make and export scatterplot
# scatterplot y vs x, color points using the logical variable
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=x, y=y, color=logi_vec)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_jf3285_files/figure-gfm/df_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# export the first scatterplot to project directory
ggsave("scatter plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)

# scatterplot y vs x, color points using the numeric variable
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=x, y=y, color=num_vec)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_jf3285_files/figure-gfm/df_plot-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# scatterplot y vs x, color points using the factor variable
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=x, y=y, color=factor_vec)) + geom_point()
```

From the three scatterplots genereated above, it can be seen that the
two scatterplots color points using logical and factor variables look
essentially the same, with legends showing the TRUE/FALSE logical/factor
vectors. On the other hand, the legend of the scatterplot color points
using the numeric variable is presented as a gradient based on different
numeric values. This demonstrates that the color scales of logical
variables are TRUE(s)\&FALSE(s), the color scales of factor variables
are the different levels, and the color scales of numeric variables are
the different numeric values.

### Description of vectors using inline R code

The size of the dataset is 500 rows and 5 columns.

The mean of x is 0.0018388.

The median of x is -0.0207073.

The standard deviation of x is 1.0348139.

The proportion of cases for which x + y \> 1 is 0.232.
